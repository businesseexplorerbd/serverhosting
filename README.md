# Server Hosting Providers

This list is not a comprehensive list of hosting providers, only those
that Dataplane.org has recently utilized are included.  Therefore, by
definition, this is a woefully incomplete and imperfect list of server
hosting providers.

Dataplane.org utilizes server hosting providers for a variety of system,
signal, measurement, and analysis projects.  We generally use KVM-based
virtual servers or dedicated (bare metal) systems that can run the
latest stable version of Debian.  Our resource requirements are modest.
For example, as of this writing, a sensor VM with 512MB of RAM, a 10GB
disk, one IPv4 address, IPv6 address, and the equivalent of a shared 10
Mb/s link is more than enough.  The ability to remotely reboot and
re-install a minimal, relatively current Debian amd64 (x86_64) system
without support intervention is highly desirable.  Geographic diversity
and a diverse set of IP address assignments across our sensor nodes is
of particular interest and sometimes drives our interest in certain
providers.  With very few exceptions, PayPal billing is the payment
method of choice.  We are happy to provide complete contact information
and even voice verification, but with very rare exception we do not do
business with providers that request copies or scans of a private
government-issued identification or billing statement.

Brief notes or comments about a server hosting provider based on
Dataplane.org's experience with them may be included.  Only factual or
reasonably objective statements will be made about each provider listed
here.

This list makes no endorsement for nor seeks to malign any specific
provider.  Rather, this list is simply a public record and accounting of
some Dataplane.org activities.

**Note to server hosting providers:** You may not be listed here simply
because we are not aware of you.  You may also not be listed here,
because we are aware of you and could not justify utilizing your
services.
