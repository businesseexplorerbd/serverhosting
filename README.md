# Server Hosting Providers

This list is not a comprehensive list of hosting providers, only those
that DataPlane.org has utilized or attempted to utilize are included.
Therefore, by definition, this is a woefully incomplete and imperfect
list of server hosting providers.

DataPlane.org utilizes server hosting providers for a variety of data,
feeds or measurement projects.  We prefer KVM-based virtual servers or
dedicated (bare metal) systems that can run the latest stable version of
Debian.  We prefer services that are modestly priced and accept PayPal.
We also seek rich IP address prefix diversity in IP address assignment
from providers.  We do not require much support nor an extensive array
of features.  In fact our service demands are quite modest.  We prefer
long term commitments and reasonably stable providers.  This list should
reflect these preferences.

Brief notes or comments about a server hosting provider based on
DataPlane.org's experience with them may be included.  Only factual or
reasonably objective statements will be made about each provider listed
here.

This list makes no endorsement for nor seeks to malign any specific
provider.  Rather, this list is simply a public record and accounting of
some DataPlane.org activities.

**Note to server hosting providers:** You may not be listed here simply
because we are not aware of you.  You may also not be listed here,
because we are aware of you and could not justify utilizing your
services at this time.  We will not add providers we have not worked
with or attempted to work with.  We will consider all reasonable
donations and if we can accept your contribution we will gladly add your
service to this list.  See our home page for additional project and
contact information.
